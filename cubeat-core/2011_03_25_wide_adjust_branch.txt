** URGENT: Map::next_state might have bug.... cubes are chained even when they are in the air.

** Map::next_state related crash !? -- no, it's garbage-vfx related.

** Why sometimes the bottom cubes' chain state isn't taken out?

** every piece of code that use something like "is_below_empty()" is needed to be checked again.
   they might be all wrong from the very beginning.
   -- might affect OneFading, Garbage creation, Dropping and Waiting states and related things.

1. heat value
   -- jama shooting don't use weapon (item) (see 2.) -- done, just all use onPress, not onHit.
   -- haste produce heat                 -- done
   -- jama shooting produce more heat    -- done
   -- overheat BIG icon over map, cursor change too.  -- not yet coded
   
2. no weapon  -- done
   -- no item  -- done
   -- remove from UI  -- done
   
3. warning not only at top, but also bottom, thicker  -- done

4. main menu's cubes are too crowded.  -- done (there are new designs anyway)

5. LuaJIT & new puzzle generator integration.  -- half done
   -- code need clean up. but the integration has been successful.
     -- need enumerate where I used variadic template. fuck apple-gcc... -- done
   -- ** GLITCH NOTICED ** The dying delay of chained cubes might block falling cubes, 
      thus there's a chance "they might get chained in the air."   -- WRONG, not fixed.

6. press enter to activate player control is weird.

7. in-game user control needs to be refined a little.  -- consider done for now
   -- remove weapon related controls. -- done(, see 1.)

8. pause menu -> can quit or resume game.
   -- need a formal way to terminate the game from main menu as well!
      -- quit using OS-dependent operation during a CPU vs CPU game might crash the game. 

9. "Chain" font block shooting  -- fixed. was pickable WTF!?

10. copyright / credits screens.

11. OpenAL integration, bye bye irrKlang.

12. Manymouse on Mac/Linux doable???

13. investigate about gcc46 to build native app on Mac ... (Apple frameworks not usable?)
   -- x86_64 irrlicht on Mac? How?
