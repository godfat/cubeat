** Map::next_state might have bug.... cubes are chained even when they are in the air.
   -- for puzzle mode, this is fixed for now.
   -- for versus mode, this will still affect newly created cubes, but should be hard to notice.
   -- I think we really need real_y(pixel_y) as a model property, either use this with current State
      pattern or revamp the state pattern.
   -- Why sometimes the bottom cubes' chain state isn't taken out?   
     -- ignore this for now.

1. heat value
   -- jama shooting don't use weapon (item) (see 2.) -- done, just all use onPress, not onHit.
   -- haste produce heat                 -- done
   -- jama shooting produce more heat    -- done
   -- overheat BIG icon over map, cursor change too.  
     -- done, but no sound
     -- fixed a glitch when you pressed haste and end game at the same time, it will keep hasting.
     -- fixed a glitch when puzzle mode, you can actually cause overheat by hasting.
   
2. no weapon  -- done
   -- no item  -- done
   -- remove from UI  -- done
   
3. warning not only at top, but also bottom, thicker  -- done

4. main menu's cubes are too crowded.  -- done (there are new designs anyway)

5. LuaJIT & new puzzle generator integration.  -- done
   -- code need clean up. but the integration has been successful.
     -- need enumerate where I used variadic template. fuck apple-gcc... -- done
   -- ** GLITCH NOTICED ** The dying delay of chained cubes might block falling cubes, 
      thus there's a chance "they might get chained in the air."   -- fixed.
   -- Generated answers tend to be on the right side of map.  -- done, horizontal flip for 50% chance

6. press enter to activate player control is weird. -- done, it should be tolerable for now.

7. in-game user control needs to be refined a little.  -- consider done for now
   -- remove weapon related controls. -- done(, see 1.)

8. pause menu -> can quit or resume game.
   -- need a formal way to terminate the game from main menu as well!
      -- quit using OS-dependent operation during a CPU vs CPU game might crash the game. 

9. "Chain" font block shooting  -- fixed. was pickable WTF!?

10. copyright / credits screens.

11. OpenAL integration, bye bye irrKlang.

12. Manymouse on Mac/Linux doable???

13. On Mac:
    1. cmake project does not create xcodeproj which build .app by default.
    2. resource bundle directory.
    3. absolute path must be fetched upon execution.
    4. do all above to have a working .app on OSX
   
14. We need better chaining cubes' indication. we need better indication of attacking and 
    cubes dropping and those sort of things. In short, we need better UI and user feedback design.
    
15. Stage number in current puzzle mode. -- done
  -- but actually we need something like puzzle high score that sort of things.
    -- probably a generic high score record for each of these modes.
    -- It would be unwise to implement this before we have a better simplified interface for UI.

16. ALL MUST USE ABSOLUTE PATH 
  -- should be done for both Windows and Mac, not sure about Linux.
    
17. Make default starting lines 3 only. I think a good choice would always be "num_of_colors - 1"

18. You have to "choose character for CPU" ... which is very strange.
