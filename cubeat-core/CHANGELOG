CuBeat 0.5.2 Alpha

Update since 0.5.1:

1.memory usage should now be lower now (pretty much the same as before
  we added start-up splash screen. That one was the problem.)
2.close program forcefully during gameplay should no longer crash the
  game. I made sure that master_presenter_ is killed as soon as App::
  run()'s main loop finished, so that the destruction sequence isn't
  mangled with all those god damn stupid singletons.
3.the puzzle mode in 0.5.1 introduced a new bug which let you shoot
  the uppermost cube and the game isn't failed. That should be fixed
  by now as I added a player_hit_event_ to Player to generate an event
  when the player actually hit some cube.
4.README_ZHTW file updated, and added README_EN.

CuBeat 0.5.1 Alpha

Update since 0.5 alpha:

1.all the hints for controls in game should now be appropriate.
2.puzzle mode now has a rule description in game, and you can stay
  on the same level if you failed, but the puzzle is still random.
3.puzzle mode will no longer fail on "missed shots," and can pause
  then leave to main menu now. Usually we have to make cubes in-
  visible when paused to prevent cheating, but considering this 
  game is still in alpha testing phase, so we are not adding this.
4.now AI vs AI demo mode has a hint to tell you can pause and quit.
5.added a notice on the main menu to remind players about README.
