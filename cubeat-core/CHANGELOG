CuBeat 0.5.1 Alpha

Update since 0.5 alpha:

1.all the hints for controls in game should now be appropriate.
2.puzzle mode now has a rule description in game, and you can stay
  on the same level if you failed, but the puzzle is still random.
3.puzzle mode will no longer fail on "missed shots," and can pause
  then leave to main menu now. Usually we have to make cubes in-
  visible when paused to prevent cheating, but considering this 
  game is still in alpha testing phase, so we are not adding this.
4.now AI vs AI demo mode has a hint to tell you can pause and quit.
5.added a notice on the main menu to remind players about README.
