Game Modes and Rules

  Puzzle Mode

1. Shoot to remove unwanted cubes or restore white cubes to colored cubes.
2. Do 3-in-a-lines to make many cubes disappear at the same time. 
3. Doing 3-in-a-lines to create potential chains (notice the cubes that blink),
   and doing 3-in-a-lines continuously to accumulate chains.
4. When there're potential chains in your grid, the emergency status will
   be paused for a short period.
5. 1st player will always be the left one, 2nd player the right one.
   Shoot at your opponent's cubes to directly intervene and interrupt!
6. Shooting and speeding up can cause overheat, so watch out for it.

as well.


Notices and Issues
=========================================================
1. Resolution of 1280x720 or better is required to play normally for now.

2. Multi-mice: Attach a second USB mouse to your computer and you can 
   play Player v.s. Player with 2 mice. It is recommended to attach mice 
   before the program starts. You can do it afterwards no problem, but you
   have to Alt-Tab out-and-in to make the program detect mice again.

3. The program will hide system cursor. This is for the multi mice feature,
   so if you want to unhide the cursor please press Esc or Alt-Tab.

Windows version 

1. Just start CuBeat.exe to play. Multi-mice is supported.

MacOSX version

1. Just start CuBeat.app to play. In case of any crashes or glitches, 
   please make sure your system is OSX 10.6 or newer.

2. Multi-mice is currently not supported on OSX, we are still working on it.

Linux version

1. Please make sure your OpenGL driver is updated and working properly.

2. Please apt-get libopenal1 (Ubuntu) first or make sure you have a
   working OpenAL installed.
   
3. At the top level of the unzipped folder, ./CuBeat.sh to play the game;
   if you'd like a desktop shortcut or multi-mice support, ./setup.sh to 
   setup these features. 
   
4. If you're using compiz / GNOME effects, it is recommended to turn them 
   off. (Otherwise there'll be window frame glitches, seems unsolvable.)
