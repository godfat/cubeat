3. Doing match-3's to create potential chains (notice the cubes that blink),
   and doing matches continuously to accumulate chains.
4. When there're potential chains in your grid, the emergency status will
   be paused for a short period.
5. 1st player will always be the left one, 2nd player the right one.
   Shoot at your opponent's cubes to directly intervene and interrupt!

Notices and Issues
=========================================================
1. Resolution of 1280x720 or better is required to play normally for now.

2. Multi-mice: Attach a second USB mouse to your computer and you can 
   play Player v.s. Player with 2 mice. It is recommended to attach mice 
   before the program starts. You can do it afterwards no problem, but you
   have to Alt-Tab out-and-in to make the program detect mice again.

3. The program will hide system cursor. This is for the multi mice feature,
   so if you want to unhide the cursor please press Esc or Alt-Tab.

Windows version 

1. Just start CuBeat.exe to play. Multi-mice is supported.
