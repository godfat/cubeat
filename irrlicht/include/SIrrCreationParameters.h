		game/application with antiAlias switched on, it would be a good idea to make it
		possible to switch this option off again by the user.

		/** This is only relevant for DirectX Devices, which switch to low FPU precision
		by default for performance reasons. However, this may lead to problems with the

		/** If this is set to a value other than 0, the Irrlicht Engine will be created in 
		an already existing window. For windows, set this to the HWND of the window you want.
		The windowSize and FullScreen options will be ignored when using the WindowId parameter.
		Default this is set to 0. 
		To make Irrlicht run inside the custom window, you still will have to draw Irrlicht
		on your own. You can use this loop, as usual:
		\code
		while (device->run())
		{
			driver->beginScene(true, true, 0);
			smgr->drawAll();
			driver->endScene();
		}
		\endcode
		Instead of this, you can also simply use your own message loop
		using GetMessage, DispatchMessage and whatever. Calling
		IrrlichtDevice::run() will cause Irrlicht to dispatch messages internally too. 
		You need not call Device->run() if you want to do your own message 
		dispatching loop, but Irrlicht will not be able to fetch
		user input then and you have to do it on your own using the window
		messages, DirectInput, or whatever. Also, you'll have to increment the Irrlicht timer.
		An alternative, own message dispatching loop without device->run() would
		look like this:
		\code
		MSG msg;
		while (true)
		{
			if (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
			{
				TranslateMessage(&msg);
				DispatchMessage(&msg);

				if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)
					break;
			}

			// increase virtual timer time
			device->getTimer()->tick();

			// draw engine picture
			driver->beginScene(true, true, 0);
			smgr->drawAll();
			driver->endScene();
		}
		\endcode
		However, there is no need to draw the picture this often. Just do it how you like.

		void* WindowId;

		//! Don't use or change this parameter. 
		/** Always set it to IRRLICHT_SDK_VERSION, which is done by default.
		This is needed for sdk version checks. */
		const c8* SDK_version_do_not_use;
